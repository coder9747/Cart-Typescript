Sure, I can help you create a beautiful and organized README for your project. Here's an example:

---

# Simple Cart Website

This is a simple cart website built with modern technologies.

## Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Backend

- **Server**: Express (TypeScript)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Password Encryption**: bcrypt
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **Login**: `http://localhost:port/api/v1/auth/login`
- **Register**: `http://localhost:port/api/v1/auth/register`

## Form Validation

- Used **Zod** for form validation.

## Remaining Work

### Frontend

- Implement application loading state for better user experience.

### Backend

- Dockerize the server for cross-platform compatibility.

### General

- Use TypeScript more strictly. Replace `any` with more specific types or interfaces where possible.
- The `.env` file was intentionally pushed to avoid errors while running the application.

## Note

All JavaScript files are located in the `/backend/dist` folder.

## Development Time

This application was built in 6 hours. Given more time, it can be extended into a fully functional e-commerce website.
